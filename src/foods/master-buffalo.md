## Review
I tried their Garlic Parmesan and I must say that their chicken wings are one of the best chickens I've tried so far (no lies!!!). Even though my order only costs 75 pesos, they provide great portions per serving. The chicken wings are big and the taste is great. HANDS DOWN Master Buffalo is a must-try!!!
